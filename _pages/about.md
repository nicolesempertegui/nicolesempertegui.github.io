I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href='https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme/'>Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering</a> working in <a href="https://fischbachlab.bme.cornell.edu">Claudia Fischbach's Lab</a> at Cornell University. My dissertation work focuses on leveraging engineered tools to investigate the role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating breast cancer bone metastasis progression. My other committee members are <a href="https://https://www.bme.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/ben-cosgrove/">Ben Cosgrove</a> and <a href="https://www.mse.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/lara-estroff/">Lara Estroff</a>.

Prior to joining Cornell, I earned my B.S. in <a href="https://che.eng.ua.edu">Chemical Engineering</a> with a minor in Mathematics from The University of Alabama (2019). My undergraduate research advisor was <a href="https://raolab.ua.edu/">Shreyas Rao</a>.

I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil">Guayaquil, Ecuador</a>. Outside of work, I enjoy watching Netflix, drinking coffee and trying out new restaurants.
