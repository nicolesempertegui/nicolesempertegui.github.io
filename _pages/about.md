	Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
</li>
<li>
	<i>Axiom 2</i>. 
	Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences. 
</li>
<li>
	<i>Axiom 3</i>. 
	Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
